# Task Manager Backend Developer Assignment

Welcome to the Task Manager Backend Developer Assignment! This project is designed to assess your Python skills through a series of tasks that involve working with a task management system. The assignment is divided into Level 1 (easier to moderate) and Level 2 (moderate to hard) tasks, each requiring you to implement specific logic within the provided codebase.

Your objective is to complete the logic for the given tasks inside `task_logic.py` and ensure that all API endpoints work as expected. We encourage you to use best practices, write clean and efficient code, and demonstrate your problem-solving abilities.

Good luck!



## ðŸ›  Prerequisites

Python with environment variable PIP enabled.
[Pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)


## Initial Setup

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/achalagarwal/storewise-backend-assignment
```
Navigate to the project directory

```bash
  cd storewise-backend-assignment
```
(If you are facing issues with navigation, checkout [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/D1Oe7b0RaFA?si=7XZi6mmUy0bbWacj).)

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, you can individually ```pip install``` the packages mentioned in ```requirements.txt```.

Go to the "app" directory

```bash
  cd app
```

Start the FastAPI server

```bash
  fastapi dev
```
Alternatively, you can run the ```main.py``` file.

When the terminal shows "Application startup complete", you'll know the server is running

(If you're using Replit, look for the Networks section where you can connect the internal port 8000 to external port 8000)

## Level 1

Easy to moderate tasks. Try to solve them sequentially, but skip forward if any question gets too intimidating.

### Question 1

Get all tasks, create a new task, and delete any task. Get familiar with the API endpoints.

#### API Reference

##### Get all tasks

```http
  GET /tasks
```

##### Create a task

```http
  POST /tasks
```
Request body JSON must include these:
| Request body |  Description                       |
| :-------- |  :-------------------------------- |
| `name` |  Name of the task |
| `description` |  Description of the task |
| `due_date` |  Deadline of the task (in [ISO format](https://www.google.com/search?q=iso+format+datetime))|
| `priority` |  Lower value indicates higher priority |
| `status` |  Current status of the task |
| `parent_id` |  ID of the parent task |
| `duration` |  Duration of the task in minutes |

Check the `models.py` file to understand the Task table better.

##### Delete a task

```http
  DELETE /tasks/${id}
```
Request body JSON must include these:
| Parameter |  Description                       |
| :-------- |  :-------------------------------- |
| `task_id` | ID of the task to be deleted |


### Question 2

Group tasks by parent_id and sort according to creation date in descending order. 

Note that you need to use the logic function in `tasks_logic.py` file, do not code in the `main.py` file.

### Question 3

Find the tasks with due date as the TODAY or TOMORROW, and Priority as 1.

### Question 4

Find parent tasks with no child tasks.

### Question 5

Count the number of task siblings (tasks with common parent dependency) of a particular task. The ID of the task is provided in the router function.


## Level 2

Moderate to hard questions

### Question 6

Implement fuzzy search, which takes an input, and returns the tasks whose names sound similar to the input.

You may use any library you like. 

### Question 7

Given 2 tasks, which is the subtask of the other. 

For example, if task A is the parent of task B, and task B is the parent of task C, then we can say that task C is a subtask of task A. 

Return NONE if they aren't related.

### Question 8

(For this question, you need to directly code in the router function in `main.py`)

Write an SQL query to find the tasks with the following criteria:
- Created beteen [26 August 2024, 9 September 2024]
- Boolean flag: Do not include tasks that have been completed
- Boolean flag: Do not include tasks created on Sunday

### Question 9

Simulate task execution asynchronously. 

The `worker_threads` variable signifies how many workers (threads) can be utilized. After that, the tasks would be performed asynchronously, and once a worker-thread is free, it can take up a new task. 

The amount of time a task requires is signified by the `duration/10` seconds (for demonstration purposes).
